SemiCode OS Documentation 

INSTALLATION:

  1. The live USB's have been shown to work when created through Rufus Usb Creator. 
  
Potential Bugs:

  1. When booting live, the screen is not formatted to the correct dimensions and the color is skewed on Nvidia based systems. This can be fixed by going into the settings and changing the screen dimensions.
  
  2. The Beta Version wireless network does not seem to be functional yet. A wired connection maybe a current workaround, but more testing is needed.
  
  3. The SemiCode installation tool seems to lead directly into the live image, not the installation tool.
